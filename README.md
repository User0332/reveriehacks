# TutorWiz

TutorWiz provides educational institutions with a simple solution for students requiring additional help. It allows students to ask questions which can then be verified by authorized tutors & teachers. Past questions and answers can be viewed by all students, so all answers help everyone!

We can then select "New Thread" to ask a new question, which will bring us to the thread creation page. TutorWiz supports rich text like Markdown when creating descriptions for threads. That is how our user was able to create bold text as shown below.

Now, we are in the thread viewing page and we can send chat messages, waiting for a tutor or teacher to provide guidance. The live chat interface also supports Markdown.
